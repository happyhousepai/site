text: "Super friendly and helpful staff, serving spectacular breakfast at a reasonable price. Bathrooms were clean, and toilets and showers were in separate stalls. Free water refills are a lifesaver, and the hostel cats are both quite sweet. Far enough away from everything to not be noisy, but close enough to comfortably walk. Got chilly at night, but a second blanket fixes that. Would definitely stay here again!"
