text: "Excellent hostel overall. We stayed in the private room with air con and bathroom with hot shower for a very reasonable price for 3 nights. The staff are friendly and helpful. Always very clean. Wi fi works great. There's a bar selling drinks for good prices,and a good area for eating and meeting others exists where people socialise. The owner is a really nice guy and invited me to play poker one night which I really enjoyed. Location is good just watch out for the little speed hump at night."
