text: "Not enough word limit to fully credit this place as much as we want, but in short, we had an epic stay at this hostel. booked initially for 3 days but ended up staying 11 ! A good walking distance from town, relaxed atmosphere, awesome music, great communal areas for down time and socialising. Thank you Dougal for a great time and especially to Russ, Stu and Sarah who worked there; not only great hosts but became good friends of ours over the course of our stay and made our time so enjoyable!
